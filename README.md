# SWRP-Quick-Launcher
A little script that builds a shortcut onto your desktop which acts as an auto launcher into fiveM to connect to SosaWorldRP

I have also include an icon file if you would like to change the icon of the program you can right click into its settings and set the icon file included as the icon instead of the FiveM Logo


**No Support will be given for this script so do not make a ticket. Its just a nice way for people who wants a faster way to join.**
